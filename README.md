Bitstorm: The Worldâ€™s Most Simple BitTorrent Tracker

BitStorm was originally written by <a href="https://caprioli.se/">Peter Caprioli</a> as a lightweight bittorrent tracker contained in a single PHP file. As it used only a single flat file as a database, it had difficulty scaling past ~10 announces per second.

Peter created a fork of his project to add MySQL support, allowing it to scale. In 2011, <a href="http://joshduff.com/">Josh Duff</a> made some changes to allow more efficient use of the database, and further scaling.

BitStorm: a very light bittorrent tracker that anyone can install!
